Weather app skill test

Tasks
Build a simple web app that fetches weather data from http://openweathermap.org/current. 
Allow the user to enter any number of cities to search for, in any way you prefer, but it should be possible to enter at least five cities before searching. 
Each city should be fetched asynchronously and when any result is returned, the list of results should be updated. 
Allow the user to change the ordering of the results (for example allow sorting by temperature, name of the location, etc.). 
You may use any programming language, frameworks and libraries.
